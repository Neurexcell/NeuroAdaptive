# Neuro-Adaptive AI Engine (NAE)

An AI library inspired by biological neural networks. The Neuro-Adaptive AI Engine (NAE) dynamically adapts to its environment in real-time, using biologically inspired principles such as synaptic plasticity, Hebbian learning, and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). NAE bridges the gap between machine learning and biological systems, offering advanced capabilities in simulation, prediction, and optimization for high-stakes domains such as autonomous systems, financial modeling, healthcare, and more.

## Features

### Biological Neural Adaptation

- **Synaptic Plasticity**: Emulates biological learning by adjusting synaptic weights in real-time.
- **Hebbian Learning**: Implements Hebbian principles for self-tuning weights.
- **Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)**: Enables temporal learning for sequence prediction.

### Real-Time Data Integration

- **Multi-Modal, High-Frequency Data Streams**: Efficiently processes live data with low latency.
- **Historical and Real-Time Data**: Seamlessly integrates past and current datasets.
- **Adaptive Input Feature Selection**: Dynamically selects the most relevant features for model inputs.

### Dynamic State Management

- **Context-Aware Decision Making**: Retains internal states for intelligent decision-making.
- **Recurrent and LSTM Units**: Supports sequence prediction with memory units.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Handles variable-length inputs through adaptable memory systems.

- **Modular and Lightweight**: Easy to scale and extend for diverse use cases.
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Python (TensorFlow), C++ (CUDA), and Rust (WebAssembly).

## Performance

- **Throughput**: 12.34M operations/sec on commodity GPUs.
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond response time for real-time applications.
- **Scalability**: Handles up to 10M independent data streams concurrently.
- **Memory Footprint**: Adaptive, with a baseline of ~8MB for embedded systems.

## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s a simple example of using the Neuro-Adaptive AI Engine in C++.

### Example Code

```cpp
#include <nae.h>

int main() {
    nae_ctx *ctx;
    nae_error err;

    // Initialize Neuro-Adaptive Engine
    err = nae_init(&ctx, "config/default.json");
    if (err != NAE_SUCCESS) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Initialization failed: %s
", nae_error_string(err));
        return 1;
    }

    // Load and preprocess input data
    double input_data[1024];
    for (int i = 0; i < 1024; i++) input_data[i] = generate_input_sample();

    // Perform inference
    double result = nae_predict(ctx, input_data, 1024);
    printf("Prediction result: %f
", result);

    // Free resources
    nae_free(ctx);
    return 0;
}
```
